# Ciphers
Playing around with Caesar Ciphers. User will input a message when prompted that they wish to encrypt.

Once a message is inputted, users will have the choice to choose an encryption key (positive or negative integer) using either "y", "Y", or "n", "N".

If users input "y"/"Y":
  They will be prompted to choose a key (positive or negative integer).

If users input "n"/"N":
  The default encryption key will be used.
